FILES
=====
cron.py <- code
tests.py <- some unit tests
example <- the same example than in the requirements

USAGE
=====

As described in the definition:

    $ cat example | python cron.py 16:10
    1:30 tomorrow - /bin/run_me_daily
    ....


NOTES
=====

I didn't use argparse because it was an extremely simple case, but in general it is a better option.
str.split() was good enough for parsing, so no other parsing library was required
